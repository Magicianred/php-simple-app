# Welcome to **php-simple-app**  

This is a base structure realized in **PHP**, **HTML** (throws BladeOne View Engine) and **Bootstrap** for CSS rules.  
  
It is not necessary to have a database (like SQLServer or MySQL) in order to have a site with dynamic content.  
  
You can change the content by editing the json files and the markdown of the 'data' folder. *php-simple-app* display them.  

As an example, you can show, the [Demo App](http://magicianred.altervista.org/gigs/php-base-info-site/).
